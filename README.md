# replace-vector-tile-layer

Genrates a new vector tile layer from an input map saved in an ArcGIS Pro project, then publishes it to ArcGIS Online or Enterprise. 
It then replaces the data of a specified pre-existing vector tile layer with the new one. 
The original data of the pre-existing vector tile layer is archived with a new name based on the date/time of the update.
